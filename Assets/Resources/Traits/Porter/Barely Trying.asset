  epithets:
  - the Uninspired
  - the Indifferent
  descriptionsTier1:
  - Here for the pay, not the passion.
  - Knows exactly how little work is required.
  - Emotionally checked out, physically present.
  - Somehow still part of the operation.
  - Working hard? Never heard of it. Working vaguely? Absolutely.
  - The job gets done, just not in a way you can prove.
  - "If motivation was loot, they\u2019d sell it immediately."
